# `omlib`, the ___O(ne) M(ore) lib(rary)___

This library is not the first of that type, there is certainly better ones elsewhere.  This libary is mine, experimental, with all I need.

## features

This library is done under ___Unix___, and certainly can be used under ***Windows*** with any ***Unix*** support but I did not tested it.

- the library can be compiled with `gcc` and `clang`,
- I use ***C11*** standard,
- there will be a manual.
