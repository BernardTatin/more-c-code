## the story

I use ___Makefiles___ since a long time so I did it again. I did it with a different approach: I didn't use any existing model, I started from nothing. It's a long job. Really long in today's standards. The idea here, is to create a framework of ___Makefiles___ to create new projects only by a simple configuration _i.e._ a set of variables describing the project.
