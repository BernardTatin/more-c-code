# More ___C___ code
Years ago I could not spend a day without writing at least one line of C. Here are some more of these lines. It's a set of experiments with ___C___ but also with ___Makefiles___, ___CMake___, ___CLion___ and more. There will be some documentation with unusual content.

Here are some more texts:

- [C projects](sometext/01-c-projects.md)
- [`omlib`, the ___O(ne) M(ore) lib(rary)___](sometext/02-omlib.md)

## what I've learned

- I always love coding in C,
